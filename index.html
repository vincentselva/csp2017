    <h2>Introduction</h2> 
<p> My name is Vincent Selva I am 17 years old and a senior at Gahr High School. My goal is to progress my website to 
look professional over time. Oh yea I also like to mess with code :)</p>
  
<h2> My Computer Science Class </h2> 
<body> 
<p> The class I'm in is called AP Computer Science Principles. It gives us students a introduction into the world of computer programming and/or coding. 
We are taught many skills that would be used in future careers for Computer Engineers, Scientists, etc such as Python, HTML, Java, and more. 
</p> 

<h2> Why This Class is Great </h2> 
<body> 
<p> I think this class is great for many reasons, one of them is becuase when you work in class you have the ability to experiment with whatever 
you want in your work, and choose what you create with it, instead of shoving your face in a textbook all day this class uses creativity and 
innovation, this class also inspires you to share your ideas with others so that they can make awesome creations as well. Our teacher Mr. 
Kim is a strong leader and inspiration to everyone in this class. As this website continues to grow you will start to see more in this section.
